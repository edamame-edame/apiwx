# Release Notes v0.5.1

**Release Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Type:** Major Enhancement Release

## 🚀 **Major New Features**

### **Integrated Type Stubs System**
The biggest improvement in apiwx v0.5.1 is the **complete integration of type stubs** into the main package.

#### **🎯 Zero-Configuration Type Support**
- **One-Command Installation**: `pip install apiwx` now includes complete type stubs automatically
- **No Separate Packages**: Type stubs are built into the main package - no additional installation needed
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works consistently across all development environments

#### **🔧 Enhanced Developer Experience**
- **Perfect VSCode Integration**: "Go to Definition" (F12) now correctly shows type stubs instead of source code
- **Complete IntelliSense**: Full auto-completion for all generic parameters and specialized classes
- **PEP 561 Compliance**: Fully compatible with mypy, pylance, pyright, and other type checkers

### **Smart Generic Alias Classes**
Transformed TypeAlias definitions into **real instantiable classes** with full parameter support.

#### **🎨 New Instantiable Classes**
All generic aliases are now proper classes that can be directly instantiated:

**Application Classes:**
- `AppBase` - Singleton application with full constructor
- `AppDetectWindow` - Singleton app with automatic window detection

**Window Classes:**
- `WindowWithPanel` - Window with automatic panel detection
- `WindowByPanelSize` - Window that sizes itself based on panel content
- `WindowPanelTransit` - Window with panel transition support
- `WindowSizeTransitWithPanel` - Combined panel management features

**Panel Classes:**
- `PanelDetectChildren` - Panel with automatic child detection
- `PanelWithBoarder` - Panel with configurable border drawing
- `PanelNoTransition` - Panel excluded from transition systems

**Button Classes:**
- `ButtonSingleClickDisable` - Button that disables after single click
- `ButtonDoubleClickOnly` - Button that requires double-click activation
- `ButtonClickGuard` - Button with comprehensive click protection

#### **🎯 Advanced Parameter Support**
Each generic class now includes **all specialized parameters** from its generic components:

```python
# Before v0.5.1 (TypeAlias only)
panel: PanelWithBoarder  # No constructor parameters

# v0.5.1 (Real classes with full parameters)
panel = apiwx.PanelWithBoarder(
    parent=window,
    size=(400, 300),
    pos=(10, 10),
    boarder_color="#FF0000",        # ✨ Generic-specific parameter
    boarder_thickness=2,            # ✨ Generic-specific parameter  
    boarder_offset=5                # ✨ Generic-specific parameter
)
```

## 🛠 **Technical Improvements**

### **Package Architecture**
- **Integrated Structure**: Type stubs moved from separate package to `apiwx/stubs/`
- **Automatic Distribution**: Type stubs included in package data and installed automatically
- **Simplified Deployment**: Single package handles both runtime and type information

### **Type System Enhancements**
- **21 Comprehensive Type Stub Files**: Complete coverage of all modules
- **Generic Parameter Typing**: Full type support for all generic-specific parameters
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without changes

### **Development Workflow**
- **Environment Independence**: Type support works consistently across all development setups
- **No Configuration Required**: Zero setup needed for full type checking support
- **Professional IDE Experience**: Enterprise-grade development experience out of the box

## 📋 **Migration Guide**

### **From v0.5.0 to v0.5.1**
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing code continues to work
- **Enhanced Features**: Type support is now automatic and more comprehensive
- **New Capabilities**: Generic alias classes can now be instantiated directly

### **Installation**
```bash
# Single command for complete installation
pip install apiwx==0.5.1

# No additional packages needed for type support
```

### **Usage Updates**
```python
# Enhanced generic alias usage (new capability)
import apiwx

# Direct instantiation with typed parameters
button = apiwx.ButtonClickGuard(
    parent=panel,
    label="Delete File",
    require_double_click=True,      # ✨ Fully typed
    guard_message="Confirm deletion" # ✨ Auto-completed
)

# Border panel with typed parameters
panel = apiwx.PanelWithBoarder(
    parent=window,
    boarder_color="#00FF00",        # ✨ Type-checked
    boarder_thickness=3             # ✨ IntelliSense support
)
```
